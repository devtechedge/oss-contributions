# OSS PR Playbook

One playbook for contributing pull requests to upstream open-source repositories. Work is handled through one unified OSS ledger and one operational queue covering all upstream projects. Never split a PR or scoreboard row by domain. Apply on every new PR unless the user overrides that turn.

Core goals, in priority order:

1. Quality over quantity: small, uncontested, mergeable fixes
2. A credible human voice with maintainers
3. One well-run PR at a time beats a spray of contested ones

Learned patterns live in `PATTERNS.md`. Read the matching section on demand, not the whole file. Every pattern is a hypothesis: re-verify it, never assume it still holds.

How to read this playbook: rules are stated here, once. Case evidence and machine traps are in `PATTERNS.md`. Queue state is in `docs/triage/triage.json`. If a rule appears twice, this file wins and the longer copy is stale. Dated counts rot. Re-check GitHub before quoting one.

## 0. Canonical location and cross-platform sync

This playbook is used from several agent platforms (WorkBuddy, zcode, Codex/ChatGPT). Only one copy counts, and it lives in the ledger repo:

- `devtechedge/oss-contributions` → `docs/SKILL.md`
- `devtechedge/oss-contributions` → `docs/PATTERNS.md`

Raw URLs (no auth, no API quota):

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devtechedge/oss-contributions/main/docs/SKILL.md
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devtechedge/oss-contributions/main/docs/PATTERNS.md
```

1. **Edit only the GitHub copies.** Local mirrors (`~/.agents/skills/oss/`, a Codex project file) are derivatives. A change made to a derivative is lost on the next sync.
2. **Refetch at the start of every PR session.** If the copy you are reading did not come from those URLs during this session, fetch them and follow what comes back. Working from a stale mirror is a real failure mode (a session on an older copy missed section 13 and hand-edited publication targets).
3. Raw is a CDN cache. It can serve a stale or truncated body with a 200 and no error. Compare the fetched byte count against `gh api repos/devtechedge/oss-contributions/contents/<path> --jq .size` and refetch through the contents API when they differ. Never proceed on an empty or truncated file.
4. After editing either file, push to `docs/` in the same turn (section 8.4), then run `~/.agents/skills/oss/sync-from-github.py` with no flags in the same turn so the local mirror matches canonical. A plain run rewrites canonical plus the WorkBuddy, Codex and OpenCode mirrors; `--no-zip` is a no-op. After an intentional distillation push that shrinks a file by more than 25%, add `--force` (refused unless the fetched size equals the contents API size).

Platform notes:

- **WorkBuddy / zcode**: run `~/.agents/skills/oss/sync-from-github.py` (or `.sh`) after any push. It rewrites the local skill mirror.
- **Codex / ChatGPT**: store the bootstrap snippet in project or memory instructions so it fetches both URLs before starting work.

Bootstrap snippet for any platform:

```
Before any upstream OSS PR work, fetch and follow:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devtechedge/oss-contributions/main/docs/SKILL.md
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devtechedge/oss-contributions/main/docs/PATTERNS.md
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devtechedge/oss-contributions/main/docs/triage/triage.json
These are the single source of truth and override any local copy.
```

SKILL.md and PATTERNS.md carry the rules. `triage.json` carries the state: every open, merged, closed and no-go attempt, competing PRs, and the ping dates the close rules measure from. Read it with `gh api repos/devtechedge/oss-contributions/contents/docs/triage/triage.json` and write it back with a contents PUT in the same turn. A platform that fetches only the two docs knows the rules but not the queue.

**Portability:** the rules travel in the skill, the state travels on GitHub. Moving to another platform costs one fetch and nothing else. Workspace memory files and `~/osswork` scratch scripts are convenience only and are never load-bearing.

## 1. Unified OSS workflow

| | **Unified OSS ledger** |
| --- | --- |
| Scope | All upstream OSS work across languages and domains |
| Ledger | `oss-contributions` |
| Ledger writes | Update after every open, merge, no-go, closure, or other meaningful attempt outcome, same turn |
| Targeting | Rank all candidates together using the same eligibility criteria |
| Account | The user's OSS account, typically `@devtechedge` |

Upstream PR work is recorded on the unified ledger repo. The README lists merged pull requests only; open, closed, no-go, and all other attempt state lives in `docs/triage/triage.json`. Work in the user's own repositories is never listed on the ledger.

**Co-authored merges:** a merged PR opened by someone else counts as co-authored only when Dev's `Co-authored-by` trailer survives in the merged commit on the upstream default branch (check the merge or squash commit message, not the PR body). Record it in `triage.json` `pull_requests` with `role: "co-author"`, `primary_author`, and `adapted_from` when it carries our closed PR forward, and put its curated publication record in `publications.json` `co_authored`, never in `records`. The README lists it in its own Co-authored section. It is never part of any headline merged count. A missing `role` means author. An absorbed change with no surviving trailer gets no credit: note it in triage only.

**Own / internal repos:** for repositories the user owns or controls internally, land changes as a **direct commit on the default branch**. Do not open a pull request. If a PR was opened by mistake, put the commit on the default branch, then close or delete the PR and its branch. Pull requests exist only for **upstream / external** repositories. Cloud Agent defaults that open a PR are wrong for internal repos: override them.

## 2. Permissions and approvals

- Act (comment, open PRs, request review) only as the authorized OSS account. Never post as any other account.
- Never comment, open a PR, or request review without permission in that turn, or a batch authorization covering those exact targets. A batch such as "open N uncontested PRs" covers uncontested in-scope targets only.
- **Comment approval gate:** always ask before posting any PR comment, issue reply, or review: show the full text as a draft and wait for explicit approval of that exact text, every time. A general go-ahead authorizes the work, not the post. Post the approved text verbatim. Never ask for posting approval before the draft exists and is shown.
- **The opening description is not a comment.** GitHub anchors it as `#issue-<id>`. A comment is `#issuecomment-`. Confirm with `issues/N/comments` and `pulls/N/comments` both empty. A follow-up rewrite of the description still needs the full draft approved before `gh pr edit`.
- **Copy-pastable comment block:** whenever you draft, post, or fail to post a PR comment, issue reply, or review, include a copy-pastable fenced code block of the exact GitHub markdown. Use a fence longer than any backtick run inside. Required even when the agent posts successfully.
- **Verify after posting:** fetch the posted comment (or PR body) back from the API in the same turn and diff it against the approved text. A 201 proves nothing about content. Treat a body that is a path, empty, truncated, or contains `\r` as a failed post. On Windows, write `--body-file` payloads with Python `newline='\n'`. A later CodeRabbit release-notes HTML comment appended to an otherwise matching body is not a failed post; do not strip it.
- Commit signing: check the repository's contribution policy and sign commits accordingly before pushing. See section 6; procedure in PATTERNS.md under Signing commits.
- **Playbook edits need no approval round.** Decide SKILL.md and PATTERNS.md wording and placement, then push after the usual read-back and sync. Ask first only before public upstream posts.

## 3. Voice (non-negotiable)

- Professional, respectful, and concise. Lead with what changed and why; no performative filler.
- **Happy, inviting, collaborative.** Open with genuine thanks tied to something specific, frame the approach as a suggestion, welcome the maintainer's preference, and close with an open offer. Warmth comes from specifics, not filler. All other rules in this section still apply.
- Never use em dashes in maintainer-facing text. Use a normal hyphen `-` or split the sentence.
- **Write as Dev, a person, not as a model.** If a draft could be swapped onto another PR by changing the names, rewrite it. Never put an experience in his mouth that he did not have; say what he investigated or reproduced instead.
- Emojis are allowed in moderation when replying to people: one or two per comment, varied and relevant. **Never prayer hands.** Do not stack emoji runs, and do not open or close with an emoji every time.
- Vary the opening across a batch. Comments to the same maintainer must not share an opening line or template.
- **One sentence per line in comments.** Exactly one sentence per paragraph with a blank line between. No wall-of-text blocks.
- **A bit detailed, not an essay.** Name the function, what went wrong, what changed, and how you checked it. Too thin and too long both fail.
- Prefer `Fixes #N` / `Closes #N` when the change fully resolves the issue.
- When the PR covers only part of the issue, write `Partially addresses #N` or `Part of #N`, never a closing keyword. Ledger copy follows the final upstream body; re-read at merge.
- Informal tone is reserved for private chat with the user; all public text follows this section.
- Enforcement note: some machines carry a PreToolUse hook that hard-blocks inline `gh` comment bodies containing emojis or em/en dashes. That hook is stricter than this section. If it fires on a permitted emoji, update the hook. Bodies via `--body-file` are not checked by the hook, so apply this section manually there.

## 4. Cadence and API hygiene

1. Open one new PR at a time. A second may run only with explicit user permission. Complete the full cycle per PR before hunting the next. Follow-up pushes to an existing open PR are fine while the next hunt is queued. If CONTRIBUTING says one issue at a time and wait for a review before the next, a bot review does not clear that gate; a human OWNER, MEMBER, or COLLABORATOR review, or a merge, does.
2. Run one agent session per PR lifecycle and retire it once the PR is open, the ledger is updated, and the post-run retrospective (section 8) is done. No session stays open to watch the PR. Persistent state lives in this playbook and `triage.json`.
3. Keep GitHub API volume low (account was warned about request volume). Prefer one consolidated call, reuse fetched data, no `--paginate` on large collections, no parallel API fan-out, poll CI at most every 60 seconds. Check `gh api rate_limit` before heavy scans.
4. On `resource_exhausted`: stop parallel work, wait, then resume serially.
5. Stuck handling: if a step stays blocked (hung command, missing passphrase, tool waiting on input), stop hitting the wall. Report the blocker and either move on or ask the user.

## 5. Target selection and GO criteria

A target is GO only when every item below holds. Re-check the timeline with `gh` immediately before claiming.

**Check order matters: read `.github/workflows/` before you evaluate any issue.** A repo-level auto-close or account scanner nullifies an otherwise perfect target and is invisible in the issue timeline. Evidence and detection recipes: PATTERNS.md Scan-time.

Hard gates:

- **Repo blocklist:** before scoring any issue, skip a repo whose `repositories` entry in `docs/triage/triage.json` has `no_go: true` or `agent_scan_gate: true`. Dev's stop is permanent until he lifts that flag. Do not re-list the live set here; dated name lists rot.
- Open issue, no owning assignee, no competing open fix PR. Check the issue **timeline's** `cross-referenced` events, not just body and comments. Check the **author** of any open fix PR: if it is our own account, stop, open nothing, and report the existing PR.
- No prior closed-unmerged PR on the same issue, or a clear reason why the earlier approach failed and the new one differs.
- The fix is owned by the repo being targeted; confirm companion packages before claiming.
- Reproducible or source-verifiable on the current default branch, and not already fixed on main even if the issue is still open.
- Bounded patch: small file count, plus tests where the repo has them.
- Outside contributions allowed: if CONTRIBUTING or observed behavior reserves PRs for maintainer-invited contributors, the repo is off-limits until an invite exists on that issue.
- **Submission path open** before heavy work: account blocks and hard filters can 404/FORBIDDEN PR creation while reads, forks, and fork pushes still work. Search for disabled-PR statements, confirm outside merges still happen, read `.github/workflows/` for assignment-gate auto-close bots, then probe with a bare branch PR create (`No commits between` proves the path is open). On 404/FORBIDDEN: stop, record no-go in triage, keep the branch. Evidence: PATTERNS.md Scan-time.
- **No account-level scanner or auto-close workflow** that fires at PR open and closes in seconds. List workflow files, grep for `pull_request_target` + open + close patterns and named scanners. A scheduled `stale.yml` is not this class. Confirm with created_at/closed_at gaps of ~10-20s across many PRs. Record as repo-level no-go; never refile; never reply to the bot. Recipe: PATTERNS.md Scan-time.
- **Stellar org default no-go:** `stellar/*` unless an explicit maintainer invite exists on that issue. Exception: `stellar/stellar-docs` for small docs fixes when CONTRIBUTING still allows them (re-verify each cycle). `stellar/js-stellar-sdk` is invite-gated with spam-report language; an older approved uninvited PR is not precedent.
- **Contribution policy satisfied:** CLA, signed commits, required labels, repo accepting PRs. Check triage for existing foundation CLA signatures before scoring CLA as friction. Read root `AI_POLICY.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and org `community` / `.github` repos for GenAI rules. A ban on agent-created PRs is an account-integrity hard gate (record no-go; human opens with required disclosure). Evidence: PATTERNS.md.
- **AI disclosure is mandatory-only, never volunteered.** With no policy requiring it, say nothing about AI anywhere. Disclose only exactly what a required policy or PR-template disclosure section asks for; leave template sections as placeholders for Dev to fill. A model id alone is not an answer. A policy that forbids automated agents from publishing to GitHub means the agent stops at a pushed fork branch plus drafts; Dev posts and opens. Cases: PATTERNS.md Scan-time / Preflight.
- **No design or policy gate pending.** If semantics need agreement, comment the approach and wait. Soft "consider discussing first" with no semantics dispute: implement to a pushed fork branch, post an approach comment in section 3 tone, record `approach_proposed`, open only after maintainer reply or Dev's call.
- **"Hidden as spam" is an account-level hazard.** Check `isMinimized` / `minimizedReason` via GraphQL before reporting a comment as fine (REST can lie). On spam minimize: never repost, never edit to slip past, never appeal in-thread, never send more agent-shaped text in that repo. Full reads and false-clean traps: PATTERNS.md Reading PR state.

Freshness and aliveness:

- Repo is alive: pushed within ~3 months (`pushed_at`). Uncontested issues in dormant repos are not targets.
- Repo merges outsiders, not just pushes. Require at least one non-bot outside merge in the last 30 days through a normal review, and median open-to-merge in days not months. Named misses: PATTERNS.md Merge-probability.
- Issue is recent: prefer days to a few weeks (roughly 6 weeks or less). Sort by newest at discovery.

Sizing and tilt:

- Always skip: contested issues, archived repos, vague design features, and repeat AgentScan auto-close targets from the same account on the same issue.
- Prefer small and mid-size repos. Judge open-PR queue against outside-merge throughput. Tiny repos qualify only when the owner filed the issue and has merged an outside PR recently. Skip event, hackathon, bounty, and never-merged-an-outsider repos. Cases: PATTERNS.md.
- Unsolicited size and new API tilt against. Without a maintainer ask on the issue, keep the diff under about 150 lines and prefer bug fixes.
- Saturation cap: 1 open PR in a repo is fine; 2-3 only for an exceptional fix; 4+ skip for the cycle. Count per org too. Until an org has replied to one of ours, cap at one open PR. Cold-lane evidence: PATTERNS.md (do not paste dated tallies here).

Scan mechanics (when asked to scan for N targets):

- Run read-only scan agents in parallel over disjoint repo groups. Agents never post.
- Bulk issue discovery uses core `repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues?labels=bug`, not the search API (secondary rate limit). Follow up with one timeline call per shortlisted candidate.
- **Raced-target rule (pre-claim only):** competing open PR before we opened anything → contested, stop, next candidate.
- **Never yield a PR we opened first.** A later competitor is not a reason to withdraw. Keep ours rebased and mergeable; one short note of fact is fine; offering to fold in extras is fine; closing for a competitor needs Dev that turn.
- **Persistent tracker for raced targets:** record in `triage.json` with `do_not_duplicate: true` and update when the competitor closes/merges.
- Race-check sibling issues named in the body. Read the actor on each `cross-referenced` event: a maintainer linking a core-team PR means in-house owned.
- A `cross-referenced` event pointing at a foreign repo (out-of-range numbers, 404) is noise.
- An open refactor that only touches the same line as a side effect is not a competitor: proceed, keep the diff minimal, record overlap in triage.
- Every scan re-verifies the existing candidate queue before adding names. Stamp verification dates.
- A `Potential AI issue` label on an issue we claimed means follow-ups must be extra precise and human.

## 6. Shipping steps

0. **Internal vs upstream:** own/internal repos (section 1) skip this flow: commit to the default branch and stop.
1. Default to fork, branch, and PR via `gh` when Cloud Agents are unavailable.
2. Probe the submission path before heavy work (full gate in section 5). Skip the probe when Dev has not approved opening yet; rely on account-level evidence and report probe skipped.
3. Treat briefs as leads, not specs: re-verify root cause, tests, and environment claims. Minimal root-cause fix matching repo style. No drive-bys. An unreported bug found on the same path while reproducing is its own first commit, named in the claim. Prefer a just-merged same-shape PR as template. Treat CONTRIBUTING LOC/layout/docs/branch rules as review gates. Open against the branch CONTRIBUTING and recent outside merges agree on. Detail traps: PATTERNS.md Implementation.
4. Add a focused regression that fails before and passes after when tests exist. Commit series: every commit must pass fmt, CI's exact lint, and full tests alone; refactors add nothing only a later commit uses. Traps: PATTERNS.md Implementation.
5. Add a changeset when the repo uses them. Prefer entries that need no PR number, or add the link in a second commit; never amend/force-push only to add the PR's own link. Read current release-note docs, not an old outside PR's file list.
6. Use distinct branch names when multiple PRs target the same repo.
7. Sign commits per repo policy before pushing. Add `Signed-off-by` only when recent history uses it. Unattended SSH signing on the Windows box: commit with `-c commit.gpgsign=false`, then `~/osswork/sign_commit.py`. Confirm via `pulls/N/commits` → `commit.verification.verified`. Shared Linux box has no signing key: push unsigned only when the repo allows it, else sign on Windows. Procedure: PATTERNS.md Signing commits.
8. Fix actionable bot review findings on your own code (e.g. Greptile P1). A CodeRabbit CHANGES_REQUESTED is not that class: surface it, do not push. A bot finding about pre-existing behavior outside the issue is scope creep: leave it.
9. Leave non-actionable checks alone: Vercel authorize, team-only checks, first-contribution `action_required`, coverage bot comments when that check is SUCCESS.
10. **CI must be green (or explicitly non-actionable) before reporting done.** After each push, wait and confirm. Own red → fix. Main red at base → compare failing sets; report "no new red", not "green". Empty `check-runs` is not green: read workflow `on:`, sibling PR runs, commit statuses / `statusCheckRollup`, `actions/runs`, and `check-suites` for `action_required`. Cookbook: PATTERNS.md CI and API reads that mislead.
11. Report the PR URL, plus the scoreboard when batching.

## 7. Maintainer responses (user-driven; no babysitting)

No babysitting: never set up a watch, cron, listener, or poll loop on a PR. GitHub email to the user is the trigger.

- When the user relays PR activity, read current state once. Treat bots as no-ops for action (may surface to user). Confirm `merged` before thank-you or ledger merge writes.
- **`reviewDecision` is not a person.** Require a human OWNER, MEMBER, or COLLABORATOR in `pulls/N/reviews` before saying only a merge is left or treating CHANGES_REQUESTED as work. Bot approval is not a reason to close; bot change request is not a reason to push. Evidence: PATTERNS.md Reading PR state.
- A CodeRabbit walkthrough issue comment is not the review. Walkthrough checkboxes are bot UI: do not open a PR from them, do not reply.
- Act only on human maintainer or collaborator responses: safe in-scope fixes push to the same branch; replies go through the comment approval gate.
- "Please sign your commit": if API shows `verified: true`, the ask is satisfied; no reply. If not, only the user can re-sign.
- Closing our own open PR is a last resort, and never for an approved one. Re-read `reviewDecision`, last human comments/reviews, and recent merges from the API before any close (handoff summaries rot). Prefer one polite nudge over closing a green mergeable PR with no contact after about a week; get per-PR approval before any close.
- Auto-close: mark Closed (not merged), never refile from the same account, never reply to the bot.
- **Silence and dormancy (7 + 7 days):** activity is a human other than us, or a code-review bot. CI/deploy/changeset/codecov/CLA/Vercel/Netlify do not count; our own comments do not reset the clock. After 7 days silence: one ping through the gate. After 7 more: close with one short sentence through the gate, not silently and not in a same-day burst. Absolute exemptions: already approved by a human and only waiting on merge, or a human still actively reviewing. One follow-up per PR ceiling.
- **Ping craft:** at least five sentences, gentle, concrete about files, root cause, tests, and the linked issue. One sentence per paragraph, blank lines, hyphen never em dash. Post via `--body-file`, fetch back. Space a batch about one minute apart. Log `last_ping` in triage the same turn.

## 8. Post-run retrospective (mandatory before retiring a PR session)

Every PR run ends with a retrospective when active work is done. Do not skip it on a bad outcome.

1. Revisit the full run end to end from actual commands and outputs.
2. Extract what generalized (would change behavior on a future PR in a different repo). Repo-specific point-in-time facts go to triage.
3. Write findings the same turn:
   - Generalizable lessons → `PATTERNS.md` under the matching heading.
   - If a lesson tightens a hard gate or shipping step, edit this SKILL.md too.
   - Repo-specific facts → `triage.json`, never PATTERNS.md.
   - Keep entries terse; every pattern is a hypothesis.
4. Sync: push updated SKILL/PATTERNS to `docs/` (sections 10-11), then run the section 0 sync.
5. Ask the user whether they picked up learnings; write what they offer per step 3.
6. Only then retire the session.

## 9. Email triage (OSS inbox)

- Confirm with the user whether flagged mail is actionable before acting.
- A GitHub email about an issue or PR we have no stake in is a scan lead, not a task. Check involvement, run section 5 gates, report skip-or-go, post nothing.
- CLA emails: the user signs in the browser. Confirm only after the `license/cla` check succeeds.
- Keep: human approvals, reviews, merges, security alerts, anything from real people.
- Discard or ignore: bot-only noise (Copilot, Vercel authorize, Changeset, CodeRabbit, Qodo paused notices, surveys, sales).
- Use the correct existing Gmail labels for the OSS accounts. Never invent vague labels.

## 10. Ledger and own-repo writes

The unified ledger repo is `oss-contributions`; its README is the public product. Everything in this section lands on GitHub the same turn it is decided.

**How to write:** prefer direct `gh api` contents PUT / edit endpoints for spot edits. For whole-file transformations, scripted local rewrite is fine: `git pull --ff-only` first, push the same turn.

**Ledger commit messages must not contain `owner/repo#N`.** That creates an upstream cross-reference. Write `owner/repo <N>` or name the repo only. If one leaks, do not comment on the upstream thread. Case: PATTERNS.md Ledger writes.

**Temp payload hygiene:** write `gh api --input` payloads under the OS temp directory and delete them the same turn. On Windows, pass a native `C:\...` path. Session end: zero ledger-related files left in the workspace.

**Skill mirror:** PUT the edit to `docs/SKILL.md` or `docs/PATTERNS.md`, then run the section 0 sync. A local-only edit is lost.

## 11. Single source of truth: the GitHub repo, not the local disk

The ledger exists in exactly one place: `oss-contributions` on GitHub. The local machine is a workspace, not a mirror.

- **Read state from GitHub** via contents API. Do not assume a local copy is current.
- **Write state to GitHub** the same turn as the outcome. One PUT per file with final content.
- **Never create local ledger files** (snapshots, `_latest`/`_final`/`_backup`, working copies of triage/SKILL/PATTERNS in the workspace). Temp under OS temp only, deleted same turn. PR verification scratch stays in that PR's temp workspace and is deleted before session end.
- **Stale-copy rule:** if a local `triage_*.json` is found, treat it as a fossil. Remote is truth; never push a local copy over remote.
- **Skill mirrors:** after PUT, run `~/.agents/skills/oss/sync-from-github.py` (section 0).

### 11.1 Local clones are disposable

A clone exists to produce one PR, not to archive one.

- **Retire the clone** when the PR is open, checks are green, and triage is updated, unless it holds unpushed commits or active review iteration.
- **Confirm before deleting:** `git check-ignore -v <path>` (name lists fail both ways).
- **Check for unpushed work first.** Export a patch before deleting if the fork is gone but the clone still holds unique commits.
- **An oversized `.git` is worth a shallow re-clone** (`--depth 1 --branch <b>`). Shallow clones push normally but need `git fetch --unshallow` before history-dependent work.

## 12. Unified ledger schema discipline

- Canonical triage memory is `docs/triage/triage.json` in `oss-contributions`, and only there (see section 11).
- Keep all records in the same arrays and schema. Do not create separate domain-specific queue files.
- Preserve existing field names. Update only affected records.
- Historical portfolio documents must not override canonical triage state.
- Diff stats in ledger copy come from `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/N --jq '[.additions,.deletions,.changed_files]'` after the last push, never hand-summed from local commits.

## 13. Merge cascade (do not hand-edit publication targets)

When an upstream PR merges, do not independently edit README, resume, LinkedIn source, profile README, Wellfound source, or repository About. Trigger the ledger workflow instead. Resume, LinkedIn, Wellfound and paste files live in `devtechedge/jobsearch-private` (PII, never in this public repo). Master resume DOCX lives there too (hand-maintained; CI-patched via scripts). See `docs/SYNC.md` for script paths and career-ops local snapshot details.

One-click: Actions → **Sync merged OSS** → Run workflow. Optional `pr` = `owner/repo#number`. Optional `summary` = curated impact copy for a new publication record.

The workflow (do not hand-edit these targets instead):

1. Treats GitHub merge state as fact
2. Updates `docs/triage/triage.json`
3. Upserts `docs/triage/publications.json` without overwriting `curated: true` copy
4. Regenerates README here and professional docs in `jobsearch-private` via `--private-root private`
5. Auto-patches master resume DOCX (top 20 by rank; give new repos a `REPO_TIER` at merge time)
6. Updates repository About when `LEDGER_SYNC_TOKEN` is present (admin PATCH). Public writes run only after `validate()` passes.
7. Validates merged counts across every publication target
8. Commits only when something changed

**If About or profile README was skipped,** repair both by hand the same turn (run still reports success). Signal: About count lagging the README badge, or null `about` in the log.

**About hard rule:** finished description MUST be <= 340 chars, re-derived whole from the template on every merge, never a substring patch, never cut mid-word. GitHub caps at 350 and truncates silently. Measure before PATCH. Never mention internal triage paths in About.

Template (HARD CAP 340):

```
Public ledger of upstream open-source contributions: {count} merged pull requests across TypeScript, Rust and Python. Merged into {names}, covering SDKs, tooling, frameworks, databases, docs and concurrency fixes.
```

`{count}` is authored merged total (co-authored excluded). `{names}` is distinct authored merged repos, alpha-sorted, joined with ", " and a final " and ". Shed to fit: drop the ", covering ..." clause first, then drop names from the end and append " and more". Enforcement: `aboutDescription()` in `scripts/sync-merged-oss.mjs` (`ABOUT_HARD_CAP = 340`). Live names come from `publications.json`; do not embed a dated name list here.

**Profile README:** restore the token and re-run the workflow (fragment renders in-memory; no on-disk copy).

**After every green merge run,** paste live LinkedIn and Wellfound from the regenerated `jobsearch-private` files and confirm the live count matches the README badge. Frozen sections stay untouched unless Dev decides otherwise.

Canonical operational record: `docs/triage/triage.json`
Canonical publication copy: `docs/triage/publications.json`
Human-only: GitHub profile bio, PATTERNS.md (unless a new generalizable lesson exists), social preview. `all_repos.md` lives in `jobsearch-private` root, human-only.

## 14. Publication copy quality (merged entries must explain the change)

Every merged PR gets real impact prose, never a one-line restatement of its title.

- Write the change in concrete technical terms: name the surface touched, then the observable consequence.
- One to three sentences, starting with what changed. No em dashes or emojis in this copy.
- **Set `curated: true` when writing it.** Check the flag on every newly merged record.
- Fill `ledger_what`, `profile_line`, `resume_bullet`, `linkedin_bullet` consistently.
- `profile_logo_alt` must not repeat the visible title; use the org or product name.
- **No em dashes** in generated copy. Separator is a plain hyphen. Check the whole `publications.json` tree, including `repos[].linkedin_representative`.
- After any sync, check `languages` on the new record (empty falls back to a wrong language). Prefer pre-seeding the full curated record before the first dispatch (PATTERNS.md Ledger publication).
- **After hand-fixing a record, re-run Sync merged OSS.** Curated copy is left alone, so re-running is safe.

## 15. Gratitude to maintainers after a merge

When a human maintainer merges one of our PRs, send a short thank-you on the PR thread.

- Goes through the **comment approval gate** (section 2).
- Personalize with real first names from `gh api users/<login> --jq .name`. Never guess; blank name → handle. No @-mention.
- Name the review chain when visible.
- Warm and collaborative: enthusiasm in words, at most one `!` on the close, at most three content-tied emojis. Name the specific thing learned.
- Three or four sentences, one per paragraph. No em dashes, no ask, no follow-up question.
- If they scoped something out, thank them for that call; at most offer the left-out case as a separate issue they can ignore.
- One note per merged PR, once. Skip bot/auto/self merges. Spread multiple notes across turns.

- **Never publish maintainer praise** in README, resume, LinkedIn, or other public artifacts.

See `docs/SYNC.md`.

## 16. Fork hygiene (a fork lives only as long as its PR)

- A fork exists to serve one PR. Delete it when that PR merges or is finally closed.
- Never delete a fork that has an open PR upstream.
- Never edit upstream prose inside a fork; deletion is the right lever.
- Account-wide text sweeps cover owned repositories only; forks are out of scope.
- Before deleting: no open PR from that fork, no branch holding our work, no local clone that depends on it.
- `compare` `ahead_by > 0` does not prove a branch is ours (fork carries upstream branches). Prefer fork `created_at` vs `pushed_at` gap (branch author fields are empty). For a real gap, confirm triage records a dead end before deleting.
- Upstream keeps commits of open/closed PRs after fork deletion. Only never-opened fork pushes are at risk: check for a local clone first.
- Delete in batches of about ten; confirm open PR count unchanged after each batch.
- `gh repo delete` needs `delete_repo` scope (`gh auth refresh -s delete_repo`, interactive).
- Pruning also blunts bulk-fork account flags and keeps owned repos visible on the profile.
